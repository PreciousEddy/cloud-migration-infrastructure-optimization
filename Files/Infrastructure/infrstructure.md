## The `/infrastructure` directory contains the Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing the cloud infrastructure. The directory structure is organized as follows:

- `/infrastructure/main.tf`: The main Terraform configuration file that defines the provider and includes resource definitions.
   
- `/infrastructure/variables.tf`: The file that defines input variables used in the Terraform configuration.
   
- `/infrastructure/outputs.tf`: The file that defines the output variables that are useful for retrieving information about the provisioned resources.
   
- `/infrastructure/...`: Additional files or directories based on the specific resources and their configurations.
   
Please refer to the individual files and their comments for detailed explanations of each resource and its configuration. Ensure you have the necessary permissions and credentials to deploy the infrastructure using Terraform.
