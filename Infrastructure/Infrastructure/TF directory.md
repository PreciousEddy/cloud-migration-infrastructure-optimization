## `/infrastructure` Directory

The `/infrastructure` directory contains the Terraform configurations for provisioning and managing the cloud infrastructure. The directory structure and files are organized as follows:

- `main.tf`: The main Terraform configuration file that defines the provider and includes resource definitions for provisioning the infrastructure components.

- `variables.tf`: The file that defines the input variables used in the Terraform configuration. These variables allow parameterization of the infrastructure code, making it more flexible and reusable.

- `outputs.tf`: The file that defines the output variables providing useful information about the provisioned resources. These outputs can be used by other modules or scripts that depend on the infrastructure.

- `network.tf`: The file containing the Terraform code for creating the network infrastructure, such as virtual networks, subnets, security groups, and routing tables.

- `compute.tf`: The file including the Terraform code for provisioning compute resources, such as virtual machines (VMs), containers, or serverless functions.

- `storage.tf`: The file containing the Terraform code for provisioning storage resources, including block storage, object storage, or databases.

- `loadbalancer.tf`: The file including the Terraform code for creating load balancers or application delivery controllers to distribute traffic across multiple instances or services.

- `database.tf`: The file containing the Terraform code for provisioning databases, such as managed database services or database instances.

- `security.tf`: The file including the Terraform code for defining security-related resources, such as security groups, access control lists (ACLs), or firewall rules.

- `autoscaling.tf`: The file containing the Terraform code for implementing auto-scaling groups to automatically adjust the number of instances based on demand.

- `monitoring.tf`: The file including the Terraform code for setting up monitoring and observability tools, such as log aggregation services, metrics collection, or alerting systems.

- `backend.tf`: The file defining the backend configuration for storing the Terraform state file. It specifies details such as the storage location or access credentials.

Please note that the file names and contents mentioned above are for illustrative purposes. You can adjust and customize them based on your specific infrastructure requirements.
