# Cloud Migration and Infrastructure Optimization

## Overview

This repository contains the documentation and code for migrating on-premises infrastructure to Microsoft Azure/AWS and optimizing it for cost-efficiency and performance. The project involved designing and implementing an architecture for scalable and highly available cloud-based applications. Infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform were utilized to automate the provisioning of cloud resources.

## Prerequisites

Before starting the migration process, make sure you have the following prerequisites in place:

1. An active subscription on Microsoft Azure/AWS.
2. Access to the cloud provider's management console.
3. Familiarity with infrastructure-as-code concepts and tools (e.g., Terraform).
4. Knowledge of cloud-native services and best practices for scalability and availability.

## Getting Started

To get started with the migration process, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Review the architecture design and documentation provided in the [Architecture](#architecture) section.
3. Set up the necessary infrastructure-as-code tools (e.g., Terraform) on your local machine.
4. Execute the provided scripts or templates to provision the required cloud resources.
5. Deploy and configure your applications on the cloud infrastructure.
6. Test the functionality and performance of your cloud-based applications.
7. Monitor and optimize the infrastructure as needed.

## Architecture

The architecture for this cloud migration project is designed to be scalable and highly available. It utilizes various cloud-native services provided by Microsoft Azure/AWS. The documentation in the [Architecture](architecture.md) file provides an overview of the design, including the different components, their interactions, and the rationale behind the architectural decisions made.

## Infrastructure-as-Code

Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) is a key aspect of this project. We have leveraged tools like Terraform to define and provision the cloud resources required for the migration. The [infrastructure](/infrastructure) directory contains the Terraform configurations for creating and managing the infrastructure components. Refer to the [README](/infrastructure/README.md) file within that directory for detailed instructions on using Terraform.

## Cost Optimization

Cost efficiency is an important consideration when migrating to the cloud. We have implemented various cost optimization strategies to ensure that resources are provisioned and utilized optimally. The [cost-optimization](cost-optimization.md) file provides an overview of the techniques employed, including rightsizing instances, leveraging reserved instances, and monitoring cost patterns.

## Performance Optimization

To maximize performance and minimize latency in the cloud environment, we have implemented performance optimization techniques. This includes leveraging cloud-native services for caching, load balancing, auto-scaling, and more. The [performance-optimization](performance-optimization.md) file outlines the strategies employed to optimize the performance of the cloud-based applications.
